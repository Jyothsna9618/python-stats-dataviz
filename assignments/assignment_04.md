# Assignment 04
1. Write code to open the text file [census_cost.txt](census_cost.txt) and read all lines into a list named **"line_list"**. Print line_list.
2. Extract the first two lines and put them in a different list named "top2_list". You will need to use them later. Print the top2_list.
3. Put the rest of the lines (containing useful data elements) in a new list named "data_list". Print data_list.
4. Extract the column **"Census Year"** from data_list and assign them to a list named **year_list**. Remove the "*" from the last element "2010*". Print the cleansed year_list.
5. Extract the **"Total Population"** column from the data_list and assign them to a list named **"pop_list"**. Remove the "," from the numbers since Python doesn't recognize them. Print the cleansed "pop_list".
6. Extract the **"Census Cost"** column from the data_list and assign them to a list named **"cost_list"**. Remove the ",", and "$", and "Billion".
Make sure to add the "0"s to the numbers from which you removed "Billion". Print the cleansed cost_list.  
7. Extract the **"Average Cost per Person"** column from the data_list and assign them to a list named **"avg_list"**. Remove the "cents", and "$".
Make sure to divide the numbers in cents by 100 so that all numbers are measured in dollar. Print the cleansed avg_list.
8. Coalesce the cleansed data and save them to a text file named "census_cost.csv". The new file should look similar to the original source file except that it is in 
comma-delimited format and the numbers have been cleansed. The top two lines from the original file should be retained in the new file.
9. Open the newly-created file "census_cost.csv", read all lines and display them. How does it look?
