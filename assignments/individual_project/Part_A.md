# Individual Project Part A
For this part, you wear a different hat. **No programming is required**. Analytical and communications skills are required.
## You ARE a
- Data analyst
- Business analyst
- Social science researcher 
## You are NOT a 
- Data scientist
- Python programmer 
- Software engineer
## Step 1. Visit the World Bank website for information about the World Development Indicators 
- https://datatopics.worldbank.org/world-development-indicators/
## Step 2. Play with the World Development Explorer (WDX) and get familar with its functionalities
- The WDX main page (the explorer) 
    - http://www.worlddev.xyz
- Use this page to understand the definition of each topic and its indicators
    - http://www.worlddev.xyz/indicators
- Use this page to get familiar with regions and countries 
    - http://www.worlddev.xyz/countries 
- Use this page to see example work from previous students   
    - https://www.worlddev.xyz/featured 
## Step 3. Think about your interests 
- Determine What Topics are interesting to you? 
    - There are 22 topics inclding Health, Environment, Education, Energy, etc.
    - For each topic of your interest, explore the vast indicators 
- Determine what indicators are interesting to you
    - You must select at least two indicators 
    - The two indicators should have some relationship/association (for example health vs wealth, education vs employment)
- Determine what countries are interesting to you
    - You must select a few countries for comparison
    - You are not just randomly picking countries 
    - You pick the countries that show some characteristics so that the comparison makes sense. 
    - For example, you may select countries in BRICS or G7 
- Determine what time span you would like to cover
    -  The data span from 1960 to 2021
    -  Your time span must be at least 5 years
    -  Suggestion: **2010 to 2020**
## Step 4. Use WDX to explore the topics and indicators of your interests
- Try to utilize all charts provided by WDX
- Download the charts that are insightful 
- Taking note of your understanding of the charts
    - what does it reveal to you?
## Step 5. Write a report using Markdown format to document your effort
- Think of yourself writing a blog that will be published on the web. 
    - For example, http://www.medium.com
- You must use Markdown file not Jupyter Notebook file
- You should provide a detailed introduction about the project, for example,
    - What is it that you are investigating/exploring/analyzing (provide sufficient background information)?
    - Why is it important to you and/or to others?
    - What questions do you have in mind and would like to answer?
    - Where do you get the data and charts to help answer your questions (give references/credits)?  
    - What process/step you use to analyze the situation/issue?
- Include the downloaded charts in your report and provide interpretations/explanations/analysis
- **Requirement A** - You compare different countries and show similarities/differences and describe your analysis 
    - Use Bar/pie charts
    - Pick one year
- **Requirement B** - You also look at the historic trend to spot any changes
    - Use Line charts
    - Use all years
- **Requirement C** - You will explore relations between two indicators 
    - For example, wealth may impact health, women's education levels may impact their employment.
    - Use scatter plots (scatter and/or bubble chart)
    - You **MUST** use data from all countries (not just data from the countries you choose). Becasue we need large sample size to infer on association/relation.
## Step 6. Create a separate GitHub repository for this project
- Name the project "data690_world_dev"
- Create a Markdown file called "wdx_analysis.md" in the root folder for your report 
- Create a folder call "charts" and upload the charts there
- Create a folder called "ipynb" which will be used later for jupyter notebook(s) you develop for data visualization
- Submit the link to this repository to Black Board
