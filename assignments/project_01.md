## Step 4. Use WDX to explore the topics and indicators of your interests
- Try to utilize all charts provided by WDX
- Download the charts that are insightful 
- Taking note of your understanding of the charts
    - what does it reveal to you?
## Step 5. Write a report using Markdown format to document your effort

- You compare different countries and show similarities/differences and their implcations
- You also look at the historic trend to spot any changes
- You will also explore relations between different topics/indicators 
    - For example, wealth may impact health, women's education levels may impact their employment.
    - Use scatter plots (2D scatter plot and/or bubble chart)
## Step 6. Create a separate GitHub repository for this project
- Name the project "world_development_explorer"
- Create a folder call "charts" and upload the charts there
- Create a Markdown file called "wdx_analysis.md" for your report
- Submit the link to this repository to Black Board
