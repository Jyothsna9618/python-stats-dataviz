# Assignment 10 Alternative
I would like you to watch the following video on Youtube (about 1 hour 30 minutes long) as an alternative to our Thursday class: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYie42M1ZyU This video discusses the concept of tidy data and how to use Pandas to make data tidy. This is a great refresher of Pandas. You will also learn new things that we have not covered in our class which may help with your individual project.
The data files and notebooks used in the video are hosted in GitHub: https://github.com/chendaniely/pydatadc_2018-tidy
It would be more effective if you download the data files from GitHub and create/write/run your own notebooks as you follow along with the speaker. You will write a list of a few interesting and new things you learn from this video and submit it to the BlackBoard as the homework for this week (due 11/25). Wish you all a happy, fun, and relaxed Thanksgiving holiday.
