Use this template Jupyter Notebook file in this same folder: **assignment_fall2020/assignment_10.ipynb**

Watch the following video on Youtube (about 1 hour 30 minutes long):
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYie42M1ZyU 

This video discusses the concept of **tidy data** and how to use Pandas to make data tidy. 

This is a great refresher for Pandas datqa analysis. You will also learn new things that we have not covered in our class. 

The data files and notebooks used in the video are hosted in GitHub: 
https://github.com/chendaniely/pydatadc_2018-tidy

**You must download data files from GitHub prior to playing the video.**

**You must create/write/run your own notebooks as you follow along with the speaker.**

After you are done, **create a new markdown cell at the end of your notebook and write a list of interesting things you learned from this video**.

You will upload your Jupyter notebook file to GitHub and submit the link in BlackBoard.
