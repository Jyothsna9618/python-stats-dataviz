## Special instructions

1. Please format the Jupyter Notebook file neatly and nicely for readability. Treat it as a research paper and a project in your professional portfolio.
2. The file must be self-explanatory and can stand alone so the readers understand the project without having to read other documents or ask you for clarification.
3. Use markdown cell for large block of texts such as background, data sources, list of elements and their meanings. 
4. In a code cell, use comments above a line of code or to the right of a line of code to annotate/comment the code only necessary.
5. Limit the length of outputs. For example, don't output more data than necessary. Use head/tail/sample on dataframe to limit the number of rows displayed (5 or 10 is good); 
6. Structure your notebook with headings including sequence numbers and section titles similar to a paper. Also use bold, italic, bulletted list, etc.
7. Don't do complicated techniques or too many techniques, keep it simple and focus on the clarity of concepts and the style of communications. 
8. This is a proof-of-concept deliverable which helps you practice data science. You are graded both on the substance and the style. 
9. On the substance: focus on data preparation and data visualization (make sure the plots are large enough). Statistical inference is optional.  
10. Don't boil the ocean. The issue you are looking into may be large, but you will only focus on one aspect of it and not try to solve the big problem. A couple of research questions would suffice. Don't try to answer too many questions.
