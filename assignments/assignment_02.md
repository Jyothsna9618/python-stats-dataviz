## Assignment 02
## Requirements
- Prompts a user to enter 10 integers.
- If the user enters anything other than integers, remind her that only integers are allowed and let her retry.
    - Note: **You need to detect if the user makes a mistake and let the user retry without exiting the program. The previously entered valid inputs should be kept and not lost.**
- Don't allow the user to enter more than 10 or less than 10 integers.
- Display the 10 integers back to the user at the end.
- Calculate the following statistics from the 10 integers entered and display the results back to the user:
    1. Minimum
    2. Maximum
    3. Range
    4. Mean
    5. Variance
    6. Standard Deviation

**Note:**

1. Use the basic Python concepts and methods. 
- Python's min(), max(), list's sort() function are not allowed. You need to write code to find the minimum and maximum.
- Special Python libraries such as statistics, scipy, or numpy are not allowed. 
You may need to use: 
    - loops (finite and/or infinite loop)
    - break/continue
    - try/except
    - input() function 
    - int() function

2. Implement the solution in the following two different formats:
    - A Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)
    - A Python script (.py) (**This is optional, not required**)

3. Your source code and outputs should be well formatted and easy to read and understand.

4. Provide good code documentation:
    - Use both Markdown and code comments in the Jupyter Notebook.
    - Use only comments in the Python script.

5. Your user prompts, use inputs and output displays should be nicely formatted when users run your program.

6. Create a subfolder named "assignment_02" in your personal GitHub repository and upload the notebook file to the subfolder.

7. from the DATA-690-FALL-2021 organization, refresh your repository with contents from your personal account. 

8. Copy the link to your GitHub repository URL (one in DATA-690-FALL-2021) to your assignment submission in Blackboard. No files should be uploaded to the BB.
